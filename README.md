# AngularDemo

👋 Hi, I’m @syrenly and welcome to **angular-demo** repo!

Here I' m studying Angular 17 and developing sample projects. Feel free to read my notes and study with me 🤗. 🚧 This is a work in progress 🚧

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.3 and it is currently at version 17.3.1.

⚗️⚗️⚗️ Unit test in progress...

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Last code coverage

Run `ng test --no-watch --code-coverage` to get stats about the code coverage. Current:

```
=============================== Coverage summary ===============================
Statements   : 60% ( 27/45 )
Branches     : 44.44% ( 8/18 )
Functions    : 40.9% ( 9/22 )
Lines        : 64.7% ( 22/34 )
================================================================================
```

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
